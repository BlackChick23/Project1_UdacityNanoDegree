## Project Motivation

For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [StackOverFlow survey dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) found on Kaggle containing approximately to better understand some insight in Information Technology:

- Which is the most popular field in Computer Science and it's salary?
- Which are the languages that developer usually use and it's salary?
- What time developer start their work?
- Is number of years of experience related to salary?
- Do developers think they know everything about Computer?
